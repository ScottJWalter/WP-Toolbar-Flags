# Toolbar flags

A simple plugin to provide a visual reminder of the state of 3 WP flags.  Serves 2 purposes:

- I wanted to learn more about plugin writing
- I keep forgetting the setting of those flags as I go about updating sites.

## Installation 

- Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
- Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## Changelog 

### 1.0
* Initial version of plugin
